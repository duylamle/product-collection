## 🤔 What is this?

An interactive skill for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) that guides you through building your own **AI Personal System** — a structured workspace where specialized AI agents work together under your direction.

Instead of chatting with AI one-off, you'll build a system that:

- 🎭 Has **specialized agents** (producer, reviewer, analyst) with clear roles
- 📏 Follows **behavioral rules** you define (tone, format, workflow)
- ⚡ Runs **bounded skills** (input → output) for repeatable quality
- 🧠 Accumulates **memory** so AI learns from your corrections over time
- 🔒 Uses **hooks and validators** that auto-enforce your conventions

---

## 💡 Philosophy

> **AI doesn't replace your judgment — it enhances the quality of input so YOU make better decisions.**

You become the engineering manager of your AI team: providing context, setting intent, reviewing output. AI produces drafts and analysis. You decide.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install this skill only
npx skills add duylamle/product-collection@claude-personal-workflow-builder -y

# Or install all skills from the collection
npx skills add duylamle/product-collection -y

# In Claude Code, say:
"Build my AI workflow"
# or
"Guide me through setting up my AI system"
```

## 📋 The 13 Phases

| # | Phase | What You'll Build |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | **Prerequisites** | Claude Code installed, workspace ready |
| 1 | **Intro** | Understand philosophy + architecture |
| 2 | **Self-Assessment** | Your role, pain points, MVP scope |
| 3 | **Foundation** | Workspace, root CLAUDE.md, folder structure |
| 4 | **Rules** | 3 core behavioral guardrails + overhead budget |
| 5 | **Agents** | Producer + Reviewer (why they must be separate) |
| 6 | **Skills** | Bounded capabilities with templates + framed prompts |
| 7 | **Memory & Knowledge** | Feedback system + domain context |
| 8 | **Hooks & Automation** | Validators, backup, session logging |
| 9 | **Advanced Patterns** | English-first, handoff, parallel agents |
| 10 | **Skill Absorption** | Learn from community skills on skills.sh |
| 11 | **Tuning** | Escalation ladder: feedback → rule → validator |
| 12 | **Iterate & Grow** | Monthly review, publishing, scaling |

> 💨 **Minimum viable path:** Phases 0 → 1 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 gets you a working system.

## 🔑 Key Patterns You'll Learn

Battle-tested patterns from months of real operational use:

| Pattern | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| **Coordinator, not Orchestrator** | Main context manages everything. No extra agent layer needed |
| **Producer/Reviewer split** | AI that reviews its own work is defensive. Separate them |
| **Framed task prompt** | Brief agents like onboarding a colleague. Prompt quality = output quality |
| **Overhead budget** | Cap auto-load lines. System grows, context cost doesn't |
| **Read before execute** | Don't trust "I remember." Re-read conventions before producing |
| **Validators > willpower** | "Impossible to violate" beats "remember to follow" |
| **Memory decay** | Feedback bloats over time. Archive monthly. Keep context lean |
| **Skill Absorption** | Bootstrap your skill → benchmark vs community → absorb best parts → delete theirs |
| **Consultant Model** | Not everything needs absorbing. Keep external kits as consultants, promote when proven |
| **Upgrade Path** | Re-research → gap analysis → absorb delta. Don't rebuild from scratch |
| **Tuning ladder** | Feedback → Rule → Checklist → Validator → Template. Each level harder to bypass |

## 🎯 Examples

The `examples/` folder has complete setups for three roles — ready to adapt:

| Role | Agents Included |
|---|---|
| 📝 **Content Marketer** | Writer + Analyst + Reviewer |
| 💻 **Software Developer** | Doc Writer + Code Reviewer + Debug Assistant |
| 📊 **Product Manager** | Meeting Secretary + Planner + Decision Reviewer |

Each example includes full `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT.md`, `SKILL.md`, rules, and memory entries.

## 🔄 Two Modes

| Mode | Best For |
|---|---|
| **🟢 Guided** (default) | First-time setup — walk through each phase step by step |
| **📋 Menu** | Returning users — jump to any specific phase |
