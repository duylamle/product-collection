## 🤔 What is this?

An interactive skill for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) that guides you through building your own **AI Personal System** — a structured workspace where specialized AI agents work together under your direction.

Instead of chatting with AI one-off, you'll build a system that:

- 🎭 Has **specialized agents** (producer, reviewer, analyst) with clear roles
- 📏 Follows **behavioral rules** you define (tone, format, workflow)
- ⚡ Runs **bounded skills** (input → output) for repeatable quality
- 🧠 Accumulates **memory** so AI learns from your corrections over time
- 🔒 Uses **hooks and validators** that auto-enforce your conventions

---

## 💡 Philosophy

> **AI doesn't replace your judgment — it enhances the quality of input so YOU make better decisions.**

You become the engineering manager of your AI team: providing context, setting intent, reviewing output. AI produces drafts and analysis. You decide.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install the skill
npx skills add duylamle/product-collection@claude-personal-workflow-builder -y

# In Claude Code, say:
"Build my AI workflow"
# or
"Guide me through setting up my AI system"
```

## 📋 The 13 Phases

| # | Phase | What You'll Build |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | [**Prerequisites**](guide/00-prerequisites.md) | Claude Code installed, workspace ready |
| 1 | [**Intro**](guide/01-intro.md) | Understand philosophy + architecture |
| 2 | [**Self-Assessment**](guide/02-self-assessment.md) | Your role, pain points, MVP scope |
| 3 | [**Foundation**](guide/03-foundation.md) | Workspace, root CLAUDE.md, folder structure |
| 4 | [**Rules**](guide/04-rules.md) | 3 core behavioral guardrails + overhead budget |
| 5 | [**Agents**](guide/05-agents.md) | Producer + Reviewer (why they must be separate) |
| 6 | [**Skills**](guide/06-skills.md) | Bounded capabilities with templates + framed prompts |
| 7 | [**Memory & Knowledge**](guide/07-memory-knowledge.md) | Feedback system + domain context |
| 8 | [**Hooks & Automation**](guide/08-hooks-automation.md) | Validators, backup, session logging |
| 9 | [**Advanced Patterns**](guide/09-advanced-patterns.md) | English-first, handoff, parallel agents |
| 10 | [**Skill Absorption**](guide/10-skill-absorption.md) | Learn from community skills on skills.sh |
| 11 | [**Tuning**](guide/11-tuning.md) | Escalation ladder: feedback → rule → validator |
| 12 | [**Iterate & Grow**](guide/12-iterate-grow.md) | Monthly review, publishing, scaling |

> 💨 **Minimum viable path:** Phases 0 → 1 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 gets you a working system.

## 🔑 Key Patterns You'll Learn

Battle-tested patterns from months of real operational use:

| Pattern | Why It Matters |
|---|---|
| [**Coordinator, not Orchestrator**](guide/09-advanced-patterns.md) | Main context manages everything. No extra agent layer needed |
| [**Producer/Reviewer split**](guide/05-agents.md) | AI that reviews its own work is defensive. Separate them |
| [**Framed task prompt**](guide/09-advanced-patterns.md) | Brief agents like onboarding a colleague. Prompt quality = output quality |
| [**Overhead budget**](guide/04-rules.md) | Cap auto-load lines. System grows, context cost doesn't |
| [**Read before execute**](guide/04-rules.md) | Don't trust "I remember." Re-read conventions before producing |
| [**Validators > willpower**](guide/08-hooks-automation.md) | "Impossible to violate" beats "remember to follow" |
| [**Memory decay**](guide/07-memory-knowledge.md) | Feedback bloats over time. Archive monthly. Keep context lean |
| [**Skill Absorption**](guide/10-skill-absorption.md) | Bootstrap your skill → benchmark vs community → absorb best parts → delete theirs |
| [**Consultant Model**](guide/10-skill-absorption.md) | Not everything needs absorbing. Keep external kits as consultants, promote when proven |
| [**Upgrade Path**](guide/12-iterate-grow.md) | Re-research → gap analysis → absorb delta. Don't rebuild from scratch |
| [**Tuning ladder**](guide/11-tuning.md) | Feedback → Rule → Checklist → Validator → Template. Each level harder to bypass |

## 🎯 Examples

The `examples/` folder has complete setups for three roles — ready to adapt:

| Role | Agents Included |
|---|---|
| 📝 [**Content Marketer**](examples/marketer-setup.md) | Writer + Analyst + Reviewer |
| 💻 [**Software Developer**](examples/developer-setup.md) | Doc Writer + Code Reviewer + Debug Assistant |
| 📊 [**Product Manager**](examples/manager-setup.md) | Meeting Secretary + Planner + Decision Reviewer |

Each example includes full `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENT.md`, `SKILL.md`, rules, and memory entries.

## 🔄 Two Modes

| Mode | Best For |
|---|---|
| **🟢 Guided** (default) | First-time setup — walk through each phase step by step |
| **📋 Menu** | Returning users — jump to any specific phase |
