# How to Build Your First Claude Code Workflow

> Hướng dẫn từng bước xây dựng hệ thống AI cá nhân với Claude Code.
> Từ con số 0 đến hệ thống hoạt động với agents, skills, rules, memory.

## What This Skill Does

This skill guides you through building a complete AI Personal System —
a structured thinking space where specialized AI agents work together
under your direction. You become the engineering manager of your AI team.

Skill này dẫn bạn qua từng bước xây dựng hệ thống AI cá nhân hoàn chỉnh —
nơi các AI agents chuyên biệt làm việc cùng nhau dưới sự điều phối của bạn.

## How to Use

**Two modes:**

- **Guided** (default) — Say "build my AI workflow" or "guide me through
  setting up my AI system". I'll walk you through each phase sequentially,
  asking for your input and generating files at each step.

- **Menu** — Say "show me the phases" or "I want to jump to phase 5".
  I'll show all 13 phases and you pick which one to work on.

## The 13 Phases

| # | Phase | What you'll build |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Prerequisites | Claude Code installed, workspace ready |
| 1 | Intro | Understand philosophy + architecture |
| 2 | Self-Assessment | Your role, pain points, MVP scope |
| 3 | Foundation | Workspace, root CLAUDE.md, folder structure |
| 4 | Rules | 3 core behavioral guardrails |
| 5 | Agents | Producer + Reviewer agents |
| 6 | Skills | 2-3 bounded capabilities with templates |
| 7 | Memory & Knowledge | Feedback system + domain context |
| 8 | Hooks & Automation | Validators, backup, session logging |
| 9 | Advanced Patterns | English-first, framed task, handoff |
| 10 | Skill Absorption | Learn from community skills |
| 11 | Tuning | Escalation ladder for improving output |
| 12 | Iterate & Grow | Monthly review, publishing, scaling |

**Quick start:** Phases 0 → 1 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 get you a working system.
Come back for 7-12 when ready to level up.

## Instructions for Claude

When the user triggers this skill:

1. Ask: "Guided mode (I'll walk you through step by step) or Menu mode
   (pick a specific phase)?"
2. **Guided mode**: Start at Phase 0. For each phase:
   - Read the corresponding guide file from `guide/0X-*.md`
   - Explain the concepts and why they matter
   - Ask the user for their specific input (role, preferences, domain)
   - Generate files in their workspace using `templates/` as base
   - Show what was created, ask if ready for next phase
3. **Menu mode**: Show the phase table above. User picks a phase.
   Read and execute that phase's guide file.
4. Reference `examples/` when the user asks "show me what this looks
   like for a [role]" — we have marketer, developer, and manager examples.
5. After each phase, briefly note what was accomplished and what comes next.

### Key principles to follow while guiding:
- Ask before generating — understand the user's role and needs first
- Generate files into their workspace, not abstractly
- Use templates/ as starting points, customize based on user input
- When user seems overwhelmed, remind them of the quick start path
- Each phase should feel like a conversation, not a lecture
